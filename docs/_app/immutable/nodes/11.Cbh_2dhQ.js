This simple tool provides immediate clarity on your average entry price, helping you make better-informed decisions without complex spreadsheets or manual math.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">At its core, the calculator tracks two key figures: total money invested and total cryptocurrency units acquired. By inputting each purchase—amount spent and price paid—it instantly computes your true weighted average entry price. This single metric reveals your breakeven point and overall position health.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Beyond basic averaging, regular use offers deeper insights. You can evaluate how new purchases would affect your average, test different contribution scenarios, or review historical performance. Transparency removes guesswork that often leads to emotional reactions.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Many investors underestimate small improvements in average entry, but over years they compound significantly. A calculator makes these dynamics visible, encouraging continued discipline.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Practical Applications</h2> <ul class="svelte-jo8es1"><li class="svelte-jo8es1">Progress Tracking: See how far current price is from your average.</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Scenario Planning: Model increasing contributions or pause effects.</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Portfolio Review: Compare averages across different assets.</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Decision Support: Inform whether to accelerate during dips.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">This utility keeps everything client-side and stateless for privacy—no data stored or transmitted.
