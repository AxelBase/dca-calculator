It tells you exactly how much you have paid, on average, for each unit of crypto you own. Knowing this number helps you assess your position, set realistic profit targets, and make informed decisions about future purchases.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The calculation is surprisingly simple yet powerful. The average entry price is determined by dividing the total amount of money you have invested by the total number of cryptocurrency units you have acquired across all purchases.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">The Core Formula</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Average Entry Price = Total Money Invested ÷ Total Units Purchased</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">For example, if you invested $1,000 to buy Bitcoin at $50,000 and later invested another $1,000 when the price was $40,000, you would have bought 0.02 BTC on the first purchase and 0.025 BTC on the second. Your total investment is $2,000, and your total Bitcoin is 0.045 BTC. The average entry price is therefore $2,000 ÷ 0.045 = approximately $44,444 per Bitcoin.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">This weighted average reflects reality far better than simply averaging the prices you paid ($50,000 and $40,000 would give $45,000—an inaccurate figure because you bought more when the price was lower).</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why This Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Tracking your true average entry price allows you to measure performance objectively. It helps answer questions like: Am I in profit overall? How far is the current market price from my breakeven point? Should I continue my DCA plan or adjust it? Without this metric, investors often rely on guesswork or emotional reactions.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Step-by-Step Example</h2> <ul class="svelte-1apmzc4"><li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Purchase 1: $500 at $60,000 → 0.008333 BTC</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Purchase 2: $500 at $45,000 → 0.011111 BTC</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Purchase 3: $500 at $55,000 → 0.009091 BTC</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Total invested: $1,500</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Total BTC: 0.028535 BTC</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Average entry: $1,500 ÷ 0.028535 ≈ $52,560 per BTC</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">This calculator automates the entire process, ensuring precision even with dozens of entries.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Should fees be included in the total investment?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Yes. For the most accurate average entry, include trading or network fees in your invested amount.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Does selling affect average entry?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">No. Average entry only considers purchases. Selling realizes profit or loss separately.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why not just average the prices?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Simple price averaging ignores the different quantities bought at each price, leading to incorrect results.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">Always use the total invested ÷ total units formula for an accurate picture of your position.</p></article></div>');function D(m){var e=T();z("1apmzc4",v=>{var s=w(),h=d(y(s),8);a(4),l(()=>c(h,"content",`${n??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),g(()=>{f.title="How the Average Entry Price is Calculated | DCA Calculator Blog"}),r(v,s)});var t=o(e),u=o(t);a(4),i(t),a(2),i(e),l(()=>c(u,"href",`${n??""}/blog`)),r(m,e)}export{D as component,x as universal};
